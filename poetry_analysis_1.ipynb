January 22, 1932\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nCould a four-year-old look out of a square sedan\\r\\r\\n(A Studebaker Six in currency green\\r\\r\\nWith wooden artillery wheels) and see a scene\\r\\r\\nOf snow, light lavender, landing on deepening blue\\r\\r\\nBuildings built out of red-violet bricks, and black\\r\\r\\nPassersby passing by over the widening white\\r\\r\\nStreets darkening blue, under a thickening white\\r\\r\\nSky suddenly undergoing sheer twilight,\\r\\r\\nAnd the yellow but whitening streetlights coming on,\\r\\r\\nAnd remember it now, though the likelihood is gone\\r\\r\\nThat it ever happened at all, and the Village is gone\\r\\r\\nThat it ever could happen in? Memory, guttering out,\\r\\r\\nApparently, finally flares up and banishes doubt.\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nII. May 29, 1941\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nTring. Bells\\r\\r\\nOn grocers\\u2019 boys\\u2019 bicycles ring,\\r\\r\\nFollowed, on cue,\\r\\r\\nBy the jaunty one-note of prayers at two\\r\\r\\nNear churches; taxi horns, a-hunt,\\r\\r\\nCome in for treble; next, the tickety bass\\r\\r\\nOf chain-driven Diamond T\\u2019s, gone elephantine\\r\\r\\nAnd stove-enamelled conifer green\\r\\r\\nDown Greenwich Avenue.\\r\\r\\nOut of the Earle\\r\\r\\nI issue at half-past thirteen,\\r\\r\\nStruck, like a floral clock,\\r\\r\\nBy seasonal\\r\\r\\nManifestations: unreasonable\\r\\r\\nN.Y.U. girls out in their bobby socks\\r\\r\\nAnd rayon blouses; meek boys with their books\\r\\r\\nWho have already moulted mackinaws;Desarrolimiento of\\r\\r\\nNew chrome-green leaves; a rose,\\r\\r\\nGot, blooming, out of bed; and Mrs. Roos-\\r\\r\\nEvelt and Sarah Delano\\r\\r\\nDescending the front stoop of a Jamesian\\r\\r\\nHouse facing south against the Square, the sun\\u2014\\r\\r\\nWho, curveting, his half course not yet run,\\r\\r\\nInfects the earth with crescence;\\r\\r\\nAnd the presence\\r\\r\\nOf process, seen in un-top-hatted,\\r\\r\\nUn-frock-coated burghers and their sons\\r\\r\\nAnd daughters, taking over\\r\\r\\nAll title, right, and interest soever\\r\\r\\nIn this, now their\\r\\r\\nProperty, Washington Square.\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nIII. December 29, 1949\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nThe Hotel Storia ascends\\r\\r\\nAbove me and my new wife; ends\\r\\r\\nEight stories of decline, despair,\\r\\r\\nIron beds and hand-washed underwear\\r\\r\\nAbove us and our leatherette\\r\\r\\nChattels, still grounded on the wet\\r\\r\\nGrey tessellated lobby floor.\\r\\r\\nSoon, through a dingy, numbered door,\\r\\r\\nWe\\u2019ll enter into our new home,\\r\\r\\nProvincials in Imperial Rome\\r\\r\\nTo seek their fortune, or, at least,\\r\\r\\nTo find a job. The wedding feast,\\r\\r\\nDigested and metabolized,\\r\\r\\nDiminishes in idealized\\r\\r\\nGroup photographs, and hard today\\r\\r\\nShunts us together and at bay.\\r\\r\\nOutside the soot-webbed window, sleet\\r\\r\\nScourges the vista of Eighth Street;\\r\\r\\nInside, the radiators clack\\r\\r\\nAnd talk and tell us to go back\\r\\r\\nWhere we came from. A lone pecan\\r\\r\\nFalls from our lunch, a sticky bun,\\r\\r\\nAnd bounces on the trampoline\\r\\r\\nOf the torn bedspread. In the mean\\r\\r\\nDistance of winter, a man sighs,\\r\\r\\nA bedstead creaks, a woman cries.\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nIV. July 14, 1951\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nA summer lull arrives in the West Village,\\r\\r\\nTransmuting houses into silent salvage\\r\\r\\nOf the last century, streets into wreckage\\r\\r\\nUncalled-for by do-gooders who police\\r\\r\\nThe moderniqueness of our ways, patrol\\r\\r\\nThe sanitation of the urban soul.\\r\\r\\nWhat I mean is, devoid of people, all\\r\\r\\nOur dwellings freeze and rust in desuetude,\\r\\r\\nFur over with untenancy, glaze grey\\r\\r\\nWith summer\\u2019s dust and incivility,\\r\\r\\nWith lack of language and engagement, while\\r\\r\\nTheir occupants sport, mutate, and transform\\r\\r\\nThemselves, play at dissembling the god Norm\\r\\r\\nFrom forward bases at Fire Island. But\\u2014\\r\\r\\nException proving rules, dissolving doubt\\u2014\\r\\r\\nYoung Gordon Walker, fledgling editor,\\r\\r\\nMy daylong colleague in the corridors\\r\\r\\nOf Power & Leicht, the trade-book publishers,\\r\\r\\nIs at home to the residue in his\\r\\r\\nAcute apartment in an angle of\\r\\r\\nAbingdon Square. And they\\u2019re all there, the rear-\\r\\r\\nGuard of the garrison of Fort New York:\\r\\r\\nThe skeleton defense of skinny girls\\r\\r\\nWho tap the typewriters of summertime;\\r\\r\\nThe pale male workers who know no time off\\r\\r\\nBecause too recently employed; the old\\r\\r\\nManhattan hands, in patched and gin-stained tweeds;\\r\\r\\nThe writers (Walker\\u2019s one), who see in their\\r\\r\\nCity as desert an oasis of\\r\\r\\nSilence and time to execute their plots\\r\\r\\nAgainst the state of things, but fall a prey\\r\\r\\nTo day succeeding day alone, and call\\r\\r\\nA party to restore themselves to all\\r\\r\\nThe inside jokes of winter, in whose caul\\r\\r\\nPeople click, kiss like billiard balls, and fall,\\r\\r\\nInsensible, into odd pockets. Dense\\r\\r\\nAs gander-feather winter snow, intense\\r\\r\\nAs inextinguishable summer sun\\r\\r\\nAt five o\\u2019clock (which it now is), the noise\\r\\r\\nOf Walker\\u2019s congeries of girls and boys\\r\\r\\nForegathered in their gabbling gratitude\\r\\r\\nStrikes down the stairwell from the altitude\\r\\r\\nOf his wide-open walk-up, beckoning\\r\\r\\nMe, solo, wife gone north, to sickening\\r\\r\\nTop-story heat and talk jackhammering\\r\\r\\nUpon the anvils of all ears. \\u201cChrist, Lou, you\\u2019re here,\\u201d\\r\\r\\nWhoops Walker, topping up a jelly jar\\r\\r\\n(\\u201cCrabapple,\\u201d says the label, still stuck on)\\r\\r\\nWith gin and tonic, a blue liquid smoke\\r\\r\\nThat seeks its level in my unexplored\\r\\r\\nInterior, and sends back a sonar ping\\r\\r\\nTo echo in my head. Two more blue gins.\\r\\r\\nThe sweat that mists my glasses interdicts\\r\\r\\nMy sizing up my interlocutor,\\r\\r\\nWho is, I think, the girl who lives next door,\\r\\r\\nA long-necked, fiddleheaded, celliform\\r\\r\\nGirl cellist propped on an improbably\\r\\r\\nSlim leg. Gin pings are now continuous.\\r\\r\\nThe room swings in its gimbals. In the bath\\r\\r\\nIs silence, blessed, relative, untorn\\r\\r\\nBy the cool drizzle of the bathtub tap,\\r\\r\\nA clear and present invitation. Like\\r\\r\\nA climber conquering K.28,\\r\\r\\nI clamber over the white porcelain\\r\\r\\nRock face, through whitish veils of rubberized\\r\\r\\nShower curtain, and at length, full-dressed, recline\\r\\r\\nIn the encaustic crater, where a fine\\r\\r\\nThread of cold water irrigates my feet,\\r\\r\\nTo sleep, perchance to dream of winter in\\r\\r\\nThe Village, fat with its full complement\\r\\r\\nOf refugees returned to their own turf\\u2014\\r\\r\\nUnspringy as it is\\u2014in a strong surf\\r\\r\\nOf retrogressing lemmings, faces fixed\\r\\r\\nOn the unlovely birthplace of their mixed\\r\\r\\nEmotions, marriages, media, and met-\\r\\r\\nAphors.

Memory, guttering out,\\r\\r\\nApparently, finally flares up and banishes doubt.\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nII. May 29, 1941\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nTring. Bells\\r\\r\\nOn grocers\\u2019 boys\\u2019 bicycles ring,\\r\\r\\nFollowed, on cue,\\r\\r\\nBy the jaunty one-note of prayers at two\\r\\r\\nNear churches; taxi horns, a-hunt,\\r\\r\\nCome in for treble; next, the tickety bass\\r\\r\\nOf chain-driven Diamond T\\u2019s, gone elephantine\\r\\r\\nAnd stove-enamelled conifer green\\r\\r\\nDown Greenwich Avenue.\\r\\r\\nOut of the Earle\\r\\r\\nI issue at half-past thirteen,\\r\\r\\nStruck, like a floral clock,\\r\\r\\nBy seasonal\\r\\r\\nManifestations: unreasonable\\r\\r\\nN.Y.U. girls out in their bobby socks\\r\\r\\nAnd rayon blouses; meek boys with their books\\r\\r\\nWho have already moulted mackinaws;Desarrolimiento of\\r\\r\\nNew chrome-green leaves; a rose,\\r\\r\\nGot, blooming, out of bed; and Mrs. Roos-\\r\\r\\nEvelt and Sarah Delano\\r\\r\\nDescending the front stoop of a Jamesian\\r\\r\\nHouse facing south against the Square, the sun\\u2014\\r\\r\\nWho, curveting, his half course not yet run,\\r\\r\\nInfects the earth with crescence;\\r\\r\\nAnd the presence\\r\\r\\nOf process, seen in un-top-hatted,\\r\\r\\nUn-frock-coated burghers and their sons\\r\\r\\nAnd daughters, taking over\\r\\r\\nAll title, right, and interest soever\\r\\r\\nIn this, now their\\r\\r\\nProperty, Washington Square.\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nIII. December 29, 1949\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nThe Hotel Storia ascends\\r\\r\\nAbove me and my new wife; ends\\r\\r\\nEight stories of decline, despair,\\r\\r\\nIron beds and hand-washed underwear\\r\\r\\nAbove us and our leatherette\\r\\r\\nChattels, still grounded on the wet\\r\\r\\nGrey tessellated lobby floor.\\r\\r\\nSoon, through a dingy, numbered door,\\r\\r\\nWe\\u2019ll enter into our new home,\\r\\r\\nProvincials in Imperial Rome\\r\\r\\nTo seek their fortune, or, at least,\\r\\r\\nTo find a job. The wedding feast,\\r\\r\\nDigested and metabolized,\\r\\r\\nDiminishes in idealized\\r\\r\\nGroup photographs, and hard today\\r\\r\\nShunts us together and at bay.\\r\\r\\nOutside the soot-webbed window, sleet\\r\\r\\nScourges the vista of Eighth Street;\\r\\r\\nInside, the radiators clack\\r\\r\\nAnd talk and tell us to go back\\r\\r\\nWhere we came from. A lone pecan\\r\\r\\nFalls from our lunch, a sticky bun,\\r\\r\\nAnd bounces on the trampoline\\r\\r\\nOf the torn bedspread. In the mean\\r\\r\\nDistance of winter, a man sighs,\\r\\r\\nA bedstead creaks, a woman cries.\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nIV. July 14, 1951\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nA summer lull arrives in the West Village,\\r\\r\\nTransmuting houses into silent salvage\\r\\r\\nOf the last century, streets into wreckage\\r\\r\\nUncalled-for by do-gooders who police\\r\\r\\nThe moderniqueness of our ways, patrol\\r\\r\\nThe sanitation of the urban soul.\\r\\r\\nWhat I mean is, devoid of people, all\\r\\r\\nOur dwellings freeze and rust in desuetude,\\r\\r\\nFur over with untenancy, glaze grey\\r\\r\\nWith summer\\u2019s dust and incivility,\\r\\r\\nWith lack of language and engagement, while\\r\\r\\nTheir occupants sport, mutate, and transform\\r\\r\\nThemselves, play at dissembling the god Norm\\r\\r\\nFrom forward bases at Fire Island. But\\u2014\\r\\r\\nException proving rules, dissolving doubt\\u2014\\r\\r\\nYoung Gordon Walker, fledgling editor,\\r\\r\\nMy daylong colleague in the corridors\\r\\r\\nOf Power & Leicht, the trade-book publishers,\\r\\r\\nIs at home to the residue in his\\r\\r\\nAcute apartment in an angle of\\r\\r\\nAbingdon Square. And they\\u2019re all there, the rear-\\r\\r\\nGuard of the garrison of Fort New York:\\r\\r\\nThe skeleton defense of skinny girls\\r\\r\\nWho tap the typewriters of summertime;\\r\\r\\nThe pale male workers who know no time off\\r\\r\\nBecause too recently employed; the old\\r\\r\\nManhattan hands, in patched and gin-stained tweeds;\\r\\r\\nThe writers (Walker\\u2019s one), who see in their\\r\\r\\nCity as desert an oasis of\\r\\r\\nSilence and time to execute their plots\\r\\r\\nAgainst the state of things, but fall a prey\\r\\r\\nTo day succeeding day alone, and call\\r\\r\\nA party to restore themselves to all\\r\\r\\nThe inside jokes of winter, in whose caul\\r\\r\\nPeople click, kiss like billiard balls, and fall,\\r\\r\\nInsensible, into odd pockets. Dense\\r\\r\\nAs gander-feather winter snow, intense\\r\\r\\nAs inextinguishable summer sun\\r\\r\\nAt five o\\u2019clock (which it now is), the noise\\r\\r\\nOf Walker\\u2019s congeries of girls and boys\\r\\r\\nForegathered in their gabbling gratitude\\r\\r\\nStrikes down the stairwell from the altitude\\r\\r\\nOf his wide-open walk-up, beckoning\\r\\r\\nMe, solo, wife gone north, to sickening\\r\\r\\nTop-story heat and talk jackhammering\\r\\r\\nUpon the anvils of all ears. \\u201cChrist, Lou, you\\u2019re here,\\u201d\\r\\r\\nWhoops Walker, topping up a jelly jar\\r\\r\\n(\\u201cCrabapple,\\u201d says the label, still stuck on)\\r\\r\\nWith gin and tonic, a blue liquid smoke\\r\\r\\nThat seeks its level in my unexplored\\r\\r\\nInterior, and sends back a sonar ping\\r\\r\\nTo echo in my head. Two more blue gins.\\r\\r\\nThe sweat that mists my glasses interdicts\\r\\r\\nMy sizing up my interlocutor,\\r\\r\\nWho is, I think, the girl who lives next door,\\r\\r\\nA long-necked, fiddleheaded, celliform\\r\\r\\nGirl cellist propped on an improbably\\r\\r\\nSlim leg. Gin pings are now continuous.\\r\\r\\nThe room swings in its gimbals. In the bath\\r\\r\\nIs silence, blessed, relative, untorn\\r\\r\\nBy the cool drizzle of the bathtub tap,\\r\\r\\nA clear and present invitation. Like\\r\\r\\nA climber conquering K.28,\\r\\r\\nI clamber over the white porcelain\\r\\r\\nRock face, through whitish veils of rubberized\\r\\r\\nShower curtain, and at length, full-dressed, recline\\r\\r\\nIn the encaustic crater, where a fine\\r\\r\\nThread of cold water irrigates my feet,\\r\\r\\nTo sleep, perchance to dream of winter in\\r\\r\\nThe Village, fat with its full complement\\r\\r\\nOf refugees returned to their own turf\\u2014\\r\\r\\nUnspringy as it is\\u2014in a strong surf\\r\\r\\nOf retrogressing lemmings, faces fixed\\r\\r\\nOn the unlovely birthplace of their mixed\\r\\r\\nEmotions, marriages, media, and met-\\r\\r\\nAphors.

December 29, 1949\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nThe Hotel Storia ascends\\r\\r\\nAbove me and my new wife; ends\\r\\r\\nEight stories of decline, despair,\\r\\r\\nIron beds and hand-washed underwear\\r\\r\\nAbove us and our leatherette\\r\\r\\nChattels, still grounded on the wet\\r\\r\\nGrey tessellated lobby floor.\\r\\r\\nSoon, through a dingy, numbered door,\\r\\r\\nWe\\u2019ll enter into our new home,\\r\\r\\nProvincials in Imperial Rome\\r\\r\\nTo seek their fortune, or, at least,\\r\\r\\nTo find a job. The wedding feast,\\r\\r\\nDigested and metabolized,\\r\\r\\nDiminishes in idealized\\r\\r\\nGroup photographs, and hard today\\r\\r\\nShunts us together and at bay.\\r\\r\\nOutside the soot-webbed window, sleet\\r\\r\\nScourges the vista of Eighth Street;\\r\\r\\nInside, the radiators clack\\r\\r\\nAnd talk and tell us to go back\\r\\r\\nWhere we came from. A lone pecan\\r\\r\\nFalls from our lunch, a sticky bun,\\r\\r\\nAnd bounces on the trampoline\\r\\r\\nOf the torn bedspread. In the mean\\r\\r\\nDistance of winter, a man sighs,\\r\\r\\nA bedstead creaks, a woman cries.\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nIV. July 14, 1951\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nA summer lull arrives in the West Village,\\r\\r\\nTransmuting houses into silent salvage\\r\\r\\nOf the last century, streets into wreckage\\r\\r\\nUncalled-for by do-gooders who police\\r\\r\\nThe moderniqueness of our ways, patrol\\r\\r\\nThe sanitation of the urban soul.\\r\\r\\nWhat I mean is, devoid of people, all\\r\\r\\nOur dwellings freeze and rust in desuetude,\\r\\r\\nFur over with untenancy, glaze grey\\r\\r\\nWith summer\\u2019s dust and incivility,\\r\\r\\nWith lack of language and engagement, while\\r\\r\\nTheir occupants sport, mutate, and transform\\r\\r\\nThemselves, play at dissembling the god Norm\\r\\r\\nFrom forward bases at Fire Island. But\\u2014\\r\\r\\nException proving rules, dissolving doubt\\u2014\\r\\r\\nYoung Gordon Walker, fledgling editor,\\r\\r\\nMy daylong colleague in the corridors\\r\\r\\nOf Power & Leicht, the trade-book publishers,\\r\\r\\nIs at home to the residue in his\\r\\r\\nAcute apartment in an angle of\\r\\r\\nAbingdon Square. And they\\u2019re all there, the rear-\\r\\r\\nGuard of the garrison of Fort New York:\\r\\r\\nThe skeleton defense of skinny girls\\r\\r\\nWho tap the typewriters of summertime;\\r\\r\\nThe pale male workers who know no time off\\r\\r\\nBecause too recently employed; the old\\r\\r\\nManhattan hands, in patched and gin-stained tweeds;\\r\\r\\nThe writers (Walker\\u2019s one), who see in their\\r\\r\\nCity as desert an oasis of\\r\\r\\nSilence and time to execute their plots\\r\\r\\nAgainst the state of things, but fall a prey\\r\\r\\nTo day succeeding day alone, and call\\r\\r\\nA party to restore themselves to all\\r\\r\\nThe inside jokes of winter, in whose caul\\r\\r\\nPeople click, kiss like billiard balls, and fall,\\r\\r\\nInsensible, into odd pockets. Dense\\r\\r\\nAs gander-feather winter snow, intense\\r\\r\\nAs inextinguishable summer sun\\r\\r\\nAt five o\\u2019clock (which it now is), the noise\\r\\r\\nOf Walker\\u2019s congeries of girls and boys\\r\\r\\nForegathered in their gabbling gratitude\\r\\r\\nStrikes down the stairwell from the altitude\\r\\r\\nOf his wide-open walk-up, beckoning\\r\\r\\nMe, solo, wife gone north, to sickening\\r\\r\\nTop-story heat and talk jackhammering\\r\\r\\nUpon the anvils of all ears. \\u201cChrist, Lou, you\\u2019re here,\\u201d\\r\\r\\nWhoops Walker, topping up a jelly jar\\r\\r\\n(\\u201cCrabapple,\\u201d says the label, still stuck on)\\r\\r\\nWith gin and tonic, a blue liquid smoke\\r\\r\\nThat seeks its level in my unexplored\\r\\r\\nInterior, and sends back a sonar ping\\r\\r\\nTo echo in my head. Two more blue gins.\\r\\r\\nThe sweat that mists my glasses interdicts\\r\\r\\nMy sizing up my interlocutor,\\r\\r\\nWho is, I think, the girl who lives next door,\\r\\r\\nA long-necked, fiddleheaded, celliform\\r\\r\\nGirl cellist propped on an improbably\\r\\r\\nSlim leg. Gin pings are now continuous.\\r\\r\\nThe room swings in its gimbals. In the bath\\r\\r\\nIs silence, blessed, relative, untorn\\r\\r\\nBy the cool drizzle of the bathtub tap,\\r\\r\\nA clear and present invitation. Like\\r\\r\\nA climber conquering K.28,\\r\\r\\nI clamber over the white porcelain\\r\\r\\nRock face, through whitish veils of rubberized\\r\\r\\nShower curtain, and at length, full-dressed, recline\\r\\r\\nIn the encaustic crater, where a fine\\r\\r\\nThread of cold water irrigates my feet,\\r\\r\\nTo sleep, perchance to dream of winter in\\r\\r\\nThe Village, fat with its full complement\\r\\r\\nOf refugees returned to their own turf\\u2014\\r\\r\\nUnspringy as it is\\u2014in a strong surf\\r\\r\\nOf retrogressing lemmings, faces fixed\\r\\r\\nOn the unlovely birthplace of their mixed\\r\\r\\nEmotions, marriages, media, and met-\\r\\r\\nAphors.
